A custom PHP-based **Content Management System** by James Minor.

## Deployment

Hamilton is designed to easily run and deploy on any LAMP stack. Below are a list of guides
for running Hamilton on a variety of platforms.

**Note:** These guides presume you have a basic understanding of being an administrator for
various linux machines and at least some experience with server-hosting platforms.

### Bitnami Virtual Machine

To deploy Hamilton on a self-hosted Bitnami VM (best for development before deployment):
1. Ensure your preferred virtualization software is installed, we recommend [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Download the `.ova` virtual machine file from [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/virtual-machine).
